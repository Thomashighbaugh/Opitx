# Opitx MarkDown Editor:
## A minimalist markdown editor that puts you in control of your files

Opitx is not your average markdown editor, which are loaded with unnecessary features that either hide your saved files in some database format you can't read or loaded with features that don't work. There are no databases on the back-end and no API calls to cost you hours of work when there is a hiccup in the syncing process. Instead Opitx uses good, old fashioned **<kbd>_SAVE_</kbd>** and **<kbd>_OPEN_</kbd>** letting you configure whatever storage scheme works best for you.
