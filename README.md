## Stop Loosing Your Work!

Every Markdown editor for Linux has the same problem, saving. Either your work is saved as some string no human could hope to read or your work won't "sync" properly with the API call the developer coded in to impress hiring managers. 

Opitx is different. There are no databases on the back-end and no API calls to cost you hours of work. Instead Opitx uses good, old fashioned **_SAVE_** and **_OPEN_** letting you configure whatever storage scheme works best for you. 


## Features
- **Markdown Based Note Taking
- **Easy Toggle Viewer 
- **Preview Pane
- **Storage Freedom 
- **Highlight JS Syntax Highlighting

## BackUp Work With DropBox 
If you are like me, you like keeping several backups of your work because you know that if you don't, you are one corrupted OS away from loosing hours of your time. 

Opitx doesn't prevent you from using whatever backup service you want, it just doesn't force you to use its method of doing so (nor is it another lame Elementary OS app). 

If you want to use it with DropBox, the process is simple. Just download the DropBox desktop app for your distribution, then when you save the file just be sure to save it in the DropBox directory and its backed up.

Want to Restore a BackUp, simply use the **_OPEN_** command and open a file from your DropBox. 

## Inspiration

>> I have used every MarkDown editor available for Linux and each time there is some issue with how the notes are stored. Either preventing me from opening my notes, having them saved in some format that is impossible to read or (if I am really lucky) costing me hours of my time because the notes are lost. 
>> So I made Opitx as a way to make an actually functional application for taking notes in MarkDown that doesn't get in my way (but isn't some hipster minimalist app) and lets me use my own directories, organizing the content in a manner that I choose. 
>> While other apps claim to solve some problem, usually for the developer, my experience with them has been nothing but new and more annoying problems. But don't believe me? Try it out, I think you'll appreciate it and if you don't, who cares it is free!

## macOS and Windows Support

Sorry, I do not use nor intend to ever use either properitery OS. While these may work fine for others, I have no need for these operating systems now that Linux has come into its own and thus will not be supporting them. 

**BUT** if any member of the community is interested in providing support for either platform, I would be appreciative (as would any potential Apple or Windows user).
